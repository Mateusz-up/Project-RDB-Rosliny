# Project-RDB-Rosliny

A student project involving the cultivation of plants.

The task is to select the fertilizer and the appropriate plants in a specific field, then choose the number of days to grow the plant. 
The next part is choosing the laboratory to whom we assign the experiment. The result of the experiment can be seen in the laboratory technician's panel.
